# My Cricket Profile

## Executive Summary
Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the country. There are over hundreds of local tournaments organized throughout the year across various locations. There is no standard system/application for organizing tournament- creation and registration process, advertising the tournament, on-boarding the sponsors for the tournament, analyzing team performance in tournament which allows teams to learn and improve their performance. All these activities are done manually and many times, especially in smaller tournaments, there are many discrepancies which make players upset. On top of all these, one very important item that is missing in small tournaments is no one is capturing user stats, which means players are selected based on word of mouth rather than statistics. 
The project aims at bridging the gap of a centralized platform for organizing tournaments and provides enrolling and managing the local cricket tournament services along with analytical capability to gain insights and analysis on the scores and other interesting stats like points, economy, etc. This application would also provide tournament organizers analytical capability to identify the most valuable player or help in deciding the tie-breakers by calculating the Net Run Rate.

## Project Background
As a local cricketer, who couldn’t make it to the state or national level, but still enjoy the game and keep playing for pure passion and love for the game, we all have stories and memories from the cricket ground that we cherish and are very proud of. But there is a very small group of people who know and can validate those stats which are significant milestones for any individual player. For example, during my school days, in a colony 15 overs match I scored a massive 204 not out. Well, I might have gotten an award and reward from the organizer but, apart from the people playing that match, organizer and few spectators, nobody knows about it. And after almost 18 years, if I tell someone about it, nobody would believe it mainly because I don’t have any proof. There are many such stories across the country at the school, gully and corporate level that are not yet captured. Our aim is to give a platform for all those players to capture these individual milestones.

## Aims & Objectives
The team formed is a bunch of cricket enthusiasts, trying to find a solution to the common IT problems faced by the local tournament organizers and introduce some modern computing and analytical power. This app also aims to advertise the tournament details, so that more and more people become aware of this and increase in the number of supporters.
Objectives are broken down based on the roles which the user plays. The primary objectives constitute the features required for minimal viable product for any users to download and use

## Relevance:
The project would be implemented using the methodologies learnt during the Cross Platform Application development course.
