# My Cricket Profile

Cricket is one of the most popular sports in the country. There are over hundreds of local tournaments organized throughout the year across various locations. There is no standard system/application for organizing tournament- creation and registration process, advertising the tournament, on-boarding the sponsors for the tournament, analyzing team performance in tournament which allows teams to learn and improve their performance. All these activities are done manually and many times, especially in smaller tournaments, there are many discrepancies which make players upset. On top of all these, one very important item that is missing in small tournaments is no one is capturing user stats, which means players are selected based on word of mouth rather than statistics.

The project aims at bridging the gap of a centralized platform for organizing tournaments and provides enrolling and managing the local cricket tournament services along with analytical capability to gain insights and analysis on the scores and other interesting stats like points, economy, etc. This application would also provide tournament organizers analytical capability to identify the most valuable player or help in deciding the tie-breakers by calculating the Net Run Rate.
